			<h1>ASI Webhelp Sample</h1>
			<p><b>The Need</b> - ASI needed documentation better suited to the situations in which their products were being used. They also needed documentation that was written for a wide variety of autonomous systems but could also be maintained by a small number of technical writers.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>The Solution</b> - Since the content of most of ASI's documentation constitute trade secrets, I can only include this brief sample I wrote as a preface to ASI's documentation deliverables. I tested a number of different single-source solutions and proposed a solution to management. That solution was a Docbook schema authored in Oxygen XML. I then worked from existing branding guidelines to modify the HTML and CSS output for the webhelp in order to provide documentation that echoed the appearance of ASI's software products. I also created a screenshot template for Adobe Photoshop, so each image in the documentation is consistent and clear. I wrote this sample as an example to help customers become comfortable with navigation and searching.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>The Outcome</b> - The now searchable documentation is more useful for customers and can now be easily handled without having to pay a large technical writing department. Support calls related to questions answered by the documentation have decreased dramatically.</p>
