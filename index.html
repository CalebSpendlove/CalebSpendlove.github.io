			<h1>Caleb Spendlove<h1>
			<p>I am a professional communicator. <br><br>Let me clarify. I specialize in the written English language, drafting any kind of document from user manuals to API documentation to software architecture. Installation and assembly instructions? I can write those. Certification and safety reports? I can write those, too. If you look around, you'll find that I write fiction, opinion, and reviews as well. "That's all very nice," you say, "but what do you really DO?" I'll sum it up with this statement.<br><br>Clear communication is my passion. <br><br>That might appear a little obvious, but you would be surprised just how often it apparently is not. Communication is far more complex than most people want to believe. It's not just the words you use, it's also the words you leave out. It's the space you leave between the lines, words, and individual letters. It's the colors and images that surround the words, the circumstances in which the words are read, and the culture of whoever is doing the reading. There's a lot to it. I have the experience needed to make educated, deliberate decisions on those points. <br><br>Communicating, like any other skill, requires consistent effort and practice to get better at it. Nearly all of my hobbies revolve around some form of communication. I love to write fiction and non-fiction, opinion and reviews. I love to draw, especially comics and graphic novels. And I read as often as I can from as many sources as I have available. I do all of those things because I enjoy them. But more importantly, those things help me become better at understanding and communicating complex thoughts and ideas. <br><br>Whatever your communication needs are, I can help. I have used many tools to craft communication for many genres. Whether what you're trying to say needs print or web, a sophisticated XML single-sourcing system or simply Microsoft Word, I can make the educated decision necessary to select a tool that will work for you. I don't want you to worry about that. At its heart, communication is about action, and I will make sure your audience gets the information they need to take action. <br><br>I am a professional communicator, and I can help you communicate professionally. It's just that simple.</p>

				<h2>Installation Guide Sample</h2>
            	<p><b>The Need</b> - Autonomous Solutions, Inc. (ASI), a vehicle automation robotics company in Petersboro, Utah, creates automation kits for many vehicles. Each of those automation kits require a hardware installation guide of some kind. In this case, the vehicle in question was a skid-steer loader. These installations are very complex and minor errors can cause serious safety problems, so the installation guide must be accurate and clear.</p>

				<h2>UFPN Data Display</h2>
            	<p><b>The Need</b> - The non-profit Utah Family Partnership Network (UFPN) needed some way to display data for each of their five centers for two audiences. The first audience was the families they wanted to help, to show them that they weren't the only ones using these services. The second was potential donors and grant committees, who needed to see that the centers themselves were being used.</p>
